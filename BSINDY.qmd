## Summary

- SINDy is a method used to estimate dynamic models from data
- This paper presents a Bayesian reformulation of the method
- The Bayesian method is more robust against noise
- There are still heathens that use MatLab

## Background

Dynamic Models

These are an "old-world" model popular in applied mathematics. They aim to "explain" underlying mechanisms.

Typical presentation:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = f(t, x(t); \Theta)
$$

. . . 

Can also be viewed as a nonlinear form of time-series regression:

$$
x(t + \Delta t) = x(t) + \Delta t \, f(t, x(t); \Theta)
$$

## Background

Usually, we like to specify the form of $f$, since we have some belief of how the system we are studying behaves.

This area of study instead focuses on the case where we want to "discover" underlying mechanisms from observations. 

## SINDy

@brunton_discovering_2016 introduces a method for estimating this under a non-Bayesian framework.

The idea is that the mechanisms in $f$ can be represented as a linear combination of functions from a pre-specified library.
